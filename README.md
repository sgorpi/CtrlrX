## About CtrlrX

[CtrlrX](https://github.com/damiensellier/CtrlrX) by [Damien Sellier](https://github.com/DamienSellier/) is an alternative fork of [Ctrlr](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr) by [Roman Kubiak](https://github.com/RomanKubiak) under BSD|GPL license. The 'X' in CtrlrX represents a commitment to delivering **extra** features, **extended** functionalities, and a **collaborative** space for its evolution.

This project is **ONLY** aimed at delivering updates, a wiki, documentation, tutorials, or anything that the community cannot share on the original [Ctrlr](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr) GitHub due to credential restrictions. Let's keep the original [Ctrlr](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr) GitHub alive and continue with what we were all doing [there](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr). But for anything that deserves special credentials unavailable on [Ctrlr](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr), let's do it on [CtrlrX](https://github.com/damiensellier/CtrlrX).

### About the Original Ctrlr

Ctrlr allows you to control any MIDI-enabled hardware: synthesizers, drum machines, samplers, effects. Create custom User Interfaces and host them as VST or AU plugins in your favorite DAWs.

* **Cross Platform:** Works on Windows (XP and up, both 64 and 32bit binaries are available), macOS (10.5 and up), Linux (any modern distro should run it).
* **Host in your DAW:** Each platform has a VST build of Ctrlr, so you can host your panels as normal VST plugins. For macOS, a special AU build is available.
* **Customize:** Each panel is an XML file and can be edited in Ctrlr to suit your specific needs.
* **Extend:** With the scripting possibilities inside Ctrlr, you can extend your panels in various ways. The Lua scripting language gives you access to all panel elements and hooks to various events.
* **Open Source:** Need special functionality or want to propose a patch/feature update? If you know a bit about C++/JUCE framework, etc., you can always download the source code and build Ctrlr by yourself.

## Licensing

The [CtrlrX](https://github.com/damiensellier/CtrlrX) project by [Damien Sellier](https://github.com/DamienSellier/) is a fork of [Ctrlr](https://github.com/RomanKubiak/ctrlr) by [Roman Kubiak](https://github.com/RomanKubiak). The original creator has generously granted permission for derivative works (forks) to choose their own licensing terms.

Specifically, Roman Kubiak stated the following regarding the Ctrlr license:

> "It means that you can use Ctrlr code in two ways."
>
> "One is a GPL licence that means if you want to use Ctrlr’s code you must include it with your product."
>
> "The other licence means that you can do whatever you want with the code, you don’t need to publish the source code, you just need to mention where did the code come from."
>
> "Panels are not covered by this license, you can do whatever you want with them, sell them, give them away whatever, noone else has the rights to them, they are your intelectual property."
>
> [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20240213071445/https://ctrlr.org/forums/topic/ctrlr-licence/#post-37755) (2015-02-11 11:58)

Based on this explicit permission, the core code of this plugin (CtrlrX) is licensed under the **[BSD-3-Clause License](LICENSE.BSD-3.md)** or **[GPL-2.0-or-later License](LICENSE.GPL-2.0.md)** - *choose and keep only the relevant one for your core project*.

### JUCE Framework Licensing

CtrlrX is built upon the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) C++ framework for audio applications. JUCE itself operates under a **dual-licensing model**:

* **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**: Available for open-source projects.
* **Commercial Licenses**: Required for proprietary commercial products.

Given that CtrlrX is an open-source project, it is generally built and used with JUCE under the terms of the **GPLv3**. This means that if you link CtrlrX with JUCE under its GPLv3 license, the resulting combined work (i.e., CtrlrX) becomes subject to the GPLv3's "copyleft" provisions. Consequently, any distribution of CtrlrX binaries linked with GPLv3-licensed JUCE, along with their corresponding source code, must comply with the GPLv3.

* JUCE is a registered trademark of Raw Material Software Limited acquired by Pace Anti-Piracy Inc.

### Crucial Note for Commercial Distribution of JUCE based softwares (including those based on this project)

If you plan to commercially distribute any product (including a derivative of CtrlrX) that uses the JUCE framework, you will typically need to obtain an appropriate **commercial license from JUCE**. Using JUCE under a commercial license allows you to distribute your proprietary products without being bound by the GPLv3's copyleft requirements for your own code.

For detailed and up-to-date information on JUCE's licensing, please visit the official JUCE website:

### AAX Plugin-Specific Licensing & Avid SDK Terms

This plugin is designed to be compiled as an AAX plugin for Pro Tools. To do so, it utilizes the Avid AAX SDK (version 2.8.1 or newer).

The Avid AAX SDK is available under **commercial or open-source licensing**. For the purposes of this open-source project, we are using the AAX SDK under the terms of the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**.

Due to the "copyleft" nature of the GPLv3, the entire distributed AAX plugin (including the portions of this project's code linked with the SDK) **must also be licensed under GPLv3**.

Therefore, any distributed AAX binaries, along with their corresponding source code, are subject to the terms of the GPLv3. You can find the full text of the GPLv3 [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

**By building or using this plugin's AAX version, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of:**

* The [Avid AAX SDK License Agreement](https://developer.avid.com/aax)
* The [Avid Privacy Policy](https://www.avid.com/legal/privacy-policy-statement)

* AAX is a registered trademark of Avid Technologies, Inc.

### Crucial Note for Commercial Distribution of AAX Plugins (including those based on this project)

While this project is open-source under GPLv3, the Avid AAX SDK itself offers a dual-licensing model. **If you intend to commercially release a third-party plugin based on this project (or any AAX plugin derived from the Avid AAX SDK), you typically need to obtain a separate commercial license from Avid for the AAX SDK and comply with their specific commercial terms, which often include requirements for AAX plugin code signing via PACE Anti-Piracy tools.**

For information on commercial AAX development and licensing, please contact Avid directly at `audiosdk@avid.com` or visit the [Avid Developer Website](https://developer.avid.com/aax).

### AudioUnit (AU/AUv3) Plugin-Specific Licensing & Apple SDK Terms

This plugin can be compiled as an AudioUnit (AU) and AudioUnit v3 (AUv3) plugin for macOS and iOS respectively. Development for these formats utilizes Apple's proprietary macOS/iOS SDKs and Xcode development tools.

Unlike VST3 or AAX, there isn't a separate, redistributable "AudioUnit SDK" with a distinct open-source license. Instead, the use of AudioUnit APIs and the distribution of AU/AUv3 plugins are governed by the **Apple Developer Program License Agreement (ADPPA)** and the terms associated with the macOS and iOS Software Development Kits (SDKs).

For the purposes of this open-source project, the compilation and use of AudioUnit frameworks fall under the general terms of Apple's developer agreements. If this project's core code is licensed under GPLv3 (due to linking with GPLv3-licensed JUCE or other SDKs), then the distributed AU/AUv3 binaries, along with their corresponding source code, are subject to the terms of the GPLv3.

* Audio Unit and AUv3 are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

### Crucial Note for Commercial Distribution & App Store Submission of AU & AUv3 Plugins (including those based on this project)
If you intend to commercially distribute an AU or AUv3 plugin derived from this project, or submit it to the Mac App Store or iOS App Store, you **must be an enrolled member of the Apple Developer Program** and comply with all terms and conditions of the **Apple Developer Program License Agreement**. This includes requirements for code signing, notarization (for macOS), and adherence to App Store review guidelines.

For detailed information on Apple's developer agreements and guidelines, please refer to the official Apple Developer website:
[https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/)
[https://developer.apple.com/audio-units/](https://developer.apple.com/audio-units/)

### VST2 Plugin-Specific Licensing & Steinberg SDK Terms

The VST2 API and SDK were officially discontinued by Steinberg in January 2022. You can find more details about this decision on Steinberg's help center: [VST 2 Discontinued](https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/4409561018258-VST-2-Discontinued).

Due to this discontinuation, we do not officially distribute a VST2.4 version of CtrlrX. However, if you are an existing licensee of the VST2 SDK from Steinberg, you may still be able to build a VST2 version of CtrlrX for your personal use or under the terms of your specific VST2 SDK license agreement.

* VST is a registered trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.

---

### VST3 Plugin-Specific Licensing & Steinberg SDK Terms

This plugin is designed to be compiled as a VST3 plugin. To do so, it utilizes the Steinberg VST3 SDK.

The Steinberg VST3 SDK is available under a **dual-licensing model**:
* **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**: For open-source projects.
* **Commercial License**: Required for commercial products.

For the purposes of this open-source project, we use the VST3 SDK under the terms of the **GPLv3**. Due to the "copyleft" nature of the GPLv3, any distributed VST3 plugin (including the portions of this project's code linked with the SDK) **must also be licensed under GPLv3**.

Therefore, any distributed VST3 binaries, along with their corresponding source code, are subject to the terms of the GPLv3. You can find the full text of the GPLv3 [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

* VST3 is a registered trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.

### Crucial Note for Commercial Distribution of VST3 Plugins (including those based on this project)

If you intend to commercially release a third-party plugin based on this project (or any VST3 plugin derived from the Steinberg VST3 SDK), you **must obtain a separate commercial license from Steinberg**. This commercial license typically has no runtime fees or royalties, but it is necessary for proprietary commercial distribution.

For detailed information on VST3 licensing, please refer to the official Steinberg VST 3 Licensing page:
[https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/VST+3+Licensing/Index.html](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/VST+3+Licensing/Index.html)

2.  **Double-click** the downloaded file to launch the macOS installer.
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts. The installer will automatically handle system security checks and guide you through selecting the **type of plugin** (Standalone APP, VST3, AU, or AAX) you wish to install.

---

### Linux

CtrlrX for Linux is distributed as a **signed $\text{.zip}$ archive** containing the necessary plugin files and libraries. Linux installations typically require manually extracting the files to the correct host application's plugin directory.

1.  **Download** the $\text{CtrlrX-Linux.zip}$ archive and the corresponding $\text{.sig}$ file from the Releases page.
2.  **Extract** the contents of the $\text{.zip}$ file. This will create a folder named `CtrlrX-*-Linux-Signed`.
3.  **Locate Your Plugin Folder:** Determine the correct location for VST/VST3/AAX plugins used by your Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Common user-level locations are:
    * **VST:** `~/.vst/`
    * **VST3:** `~/.vst3/`
4.  **Copy the Plugin:** Move the contents of the extracted folder (or the necessary plugin files themselves) into the correct plugin directory for your DAW.

---

#### Linux Signature Verification (GPG)
For security and integrity, you can verify the downloaded files using the detached **GPG signature (`.sig`)** file included in the release. This ensures the files have not been tampered with since they were signed.

##### Prerequisites

You must have **GnuPG** (often just `gpg`) installed on your system.

##### 1. Import the Public Signing Key

The files are signed with the **CtrlrX Project Key** (`FC9F02DE24F1BC96`). Fetch this key from a public keyserver:

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys FC9F02DE24F1BC96
```

##### 2. Extract and Verify

Download the main `CtrlrX-X.X.X-Linux.zip` file, which contains both the binary (e.g., `CtrlrX`) and the signature file (e.g., `CtrlrX.sig`).

1.  Extract the archive:
    ```bash
    unzip CtrlrX-*.zip
    # Navigate to the folder containing the binary and .sig file
    ```

2.  Run the verification command:

    ```bash
    gpg --verify CtrlrX.sig CtrlrX
    ```

##### Expected Output

A successful verification will show the message **`Good signature from "CtrlrX Project (LINUX GPG Signing Key) <ctrlrx@ctrlrx.org>"`**:

```
gpg: Signature made Tue Nov 4 02:46:47 2025 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 643698F0E75E...24F1BC96
gpg: Good signature from "CtrlrX Project (LINUX GPG Signing Key) <ctrlrx@ctrlrx.org>" [unknown]
```

### Linux Build Instructions

For Linux users, it is recommended to use CMake for compiling CtrlrX binaries. This requires certain development dependencies to be installed on your system.

**Required Development Dependencies (for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems):**

To ensure a successful build, install the following packages:

* **Core Build Tools:** `build-essential`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`
* **System & Utility Libraries:** `libiberty-dev`, `binutils-dev`, `libudev-dev`, `libasound2-dev`, `libtiff-dev`, `libcurl4-gnutls-dev`, `libboost-dev`
* **Graphics & X11 Development:** `libxi-dev`, `libx11-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxinerama-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libfreetype-dev`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libglapi-mesa`, `xorg-dev`
* **Specific Libraries:** `libsframe1`

To install the necessary packages, open a terminal and run the appropriate `sudo apt install` command with these dependencies. Please consult your distribution's documentation for the exact command and package names if you encounter issues.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    libxi-dev \
    libx11-dev \
    binutils-dev \

## Exporting Plugin Instances

This section covers how to export various plugin formats from CtrlrX.

### VST2 Support & Build Instructions

**Important Note: VST2 Discontinuation and SDK Availability**

**We strongly recommend that users transition to building the VST3 version of CtrlrX instead of VST2, as VST3 is the current and actively supported standard.**

Steinberg officially discontinued the VST2 API and SDK in **January 2022**. As a result, the VST2 SDK is no longer publicly available for download or new licensing. This means that for most new users, building a VST2.4 plugin directly from this project will not be possible without prior access to the SDK. For more information, please refer to Steinberg's official announcement: [VST 2 Discontinued](https://helpcenter.steinberg.de/hc/en-us/articles/4409561018258-VST-2-Discontinued).

However, if you are an **existing licensee** of the VST2 SDK (meaning you had access to it prior to its discontinuation), you can still compile a VST2 version of CtrlrX. Your ability to build and distribute this VST2.4 version of the plugin will be governed solely by the terms of your specific VST2 SDK license agreement with Steinberg.

**To build the VST2 version of this plugin (for existing licensees):**

1.  **Ensure VST2 SDK Availability:**
    Make sure you have your VST2 SDK files (specifically the `vst2.x` folder containing headers like `aeffect.h`) accessible on your system. This SDK is **not included** with JUCE and must be sourced from your prior access.

2.  **Configure JUCE Projucer Global Paths:**
    * Open the JUCE Projucer application (compatible with your JUCE 6.0.8 version).
    * Navigate to **"File" > "Global Paths..."** (or sometimes just "Settings" via the gear icon).
    * In the Global Paths window, locate the entry specifically for **"VST (Legacy) SDK"** or "VST2 SDK".
    * Set this path to the root directory where your VST2 SDK is located (e.g., the folder containing the `pluginterfaces` directory and other VST2 SDK components). This path is critical for JUCE to find the necessary VST2 headers and libraries.
    * Open your CtrlrX `.jucer` project file in Projucer, go to the "Exporters" section, and ensure the VST2 format is enabled for your target platform.

3.  **Build the CtrlrX VST2 binary:**
    Follow your project's general build instructions (e.g., via your IDE after Projucer generation, or directly with CMake) to compile the VST2 target.


### VST3 Support

To compile the VST3 version of this plugin, ensure your **JUCE installation is correctly set up to include the VST3 SDK**, as it's typically bundled with JUCE.

#### UPDATE v5.6.32+

VST3 exported instances of CtrlrX panels are finally working properly. On macOS, you need to export VST3 with at least an ad-hoc signature. This process is managed automatically by CtrlrX; if you have an Apple developer certificate, select it in the appropriate field to prevent the VST3 from being held by Gatekeeper. If you want to sign your Windows exported instances with a PFX Certificate, that's now also possible.

If for some reason you still want to produce your own VST3 intermediates, you can simply disable the unique identifiers replacement process from the appropriate field.

#### Prior v5.6.32

Currently, VST3 instances of Ctrlr panels are not working properly because Ctrlr is not able to generate different VST3 compliant plugin identifiers.

Unfortunately, exported VST3 instances of your panel will always be named after CTRLR | Instigator. The only way to get the correct identifiers for a panel project is to force them at the core during the building step of the VST3 in Xcode/VS/IDE.
To export properly identified VST3 plugins, it is then required to build a different stock CTRLR VST3 plugin with JUCE Projucer and Xcode/VS/IDE.
However, this alternative version of CTRLR VST3 will have the desired panel/plugin identifiers predefined in the Projucer settings (Plugin Name, Manufacturer Name, Plugin ID, Manufacturer ID, etc.).
This intermediate VST3 plugin will then be able to export a final VST3 version of the panel with the proper identifiers.

### AAX Support & Build Instructions

This project is built and tested with **JUCE 6.0.8**. To compile the AAX version of this plugin, you will also need to obtain the **Avid AAX SDK (version 2.8.1 or newer)** separately.

**To build the AAX version of this plugin:**

1.  **Obtain the Avid AAX SDK 2.8.1 (or newer compatible version):**
    * **Join the Avid Developer Program:** Visit the [Avid Developer website](https://developer.avid.com/aax/) and sign up for the AAX SDK program. This typically involves agreeing to their terms and creating an iLok account.
    * **Download the AAX SDK:** Once registered, navigate to the SDK download section and download "AAX SDK 2.8.1" (or the latest GPLv3-licensed version available for use with JUCE 6.0.8).
    * **Extract the SDK:** Extract the downloaded SDK archive to a stable, known location on your system (e.g., `C:\SDKs\AvidAAXSDK_2.8.1\` on Windows or `~/SDKs/AvidAAXSDK_2.8.1/` on macOS/Linux).

2.  **Build the AAX Library:**
    * Before building CtrlrX, you must compile the core AAX Library project included within the SDK. Navigate to the `Libs/AAXLibrary` directory within your extracted AAX SDK and build the project using your chosen IDE (e.g., Visual Studio on Windows, Xcode on macOS). This step generates the necessary static library (`.lib` or `.a`) that CtrlrX will link against.

3.  **Configure your build environment:**
    * **If using JUCE's Projucer (recommended for JUCE 6.0.8):**
        * Open the Projucer application (from your JUCE 6.0.8 clone).
        * Go to **"Settings"** (gear icon or File > Global Paths).
        * Under "SDK Locations" or "Module Paths", locate the entry for **"AAX SDK"** and set its path to the root directory of your extracted Avid AAX SDK (e.g., `C:\SDKs\AvidAAXSDK_2.8.1\`).
        * Open your `.jucer` project file, go to the "Exporters" section, and ensure the AAX format is enabled for your target platform.
    * **If using CMake:**
        * Your `CMakeLists.txt` will need to be configured to locate both your JUCE 6.0.8 root and the AAX SDK root.
        * You'll typically define variables (e.g., `JUCE_ROOT`, `AAX_SDK_ROOT`) and use `find_path` or explicit `set` commands, then pass `AAX_SDK_ROOT` to `juce_add_plugin` via the `AAX_SDK_PATH` argument. (Detailed CMake setup for JUCE 6.0.8 with external SDKs can be complex; a dedicated CMake guide might be needed for this if it's your primary build method).

4.  **Build the CtrlrX AAX binary:** Follow your project's general build instructions (e.g., via your IDE after Projucer generation, or directly with CMake) to compile the AAX target.
    * [Your specific build command/steps for AAX, e.g., for Projucer: "Open the .jucer project in Projucer, select the AAX target, and click 'Save and Open in IDE'. Then build in your IDE." or for CMake: `cmake --build . --config Release --target CtrlrX_AAX`]

**Additional Notes for Development and Distribution:**

* **Pro Tools Developer Version:** To test unsigned AAX plugins, you will likely need a special "Pro Tools Developer" version of Pro Tools, available through the [Avid Developer Program](https://developer.avid.com/aax).

* **PACE Codesigning:** For any distributed AAX plugin (commercial or free), you will generally need to go through the AVID authorization process via PACE codesigning tools. This is a requirement for plugins to load in standard (non-developer) Pro Tools versions. This process is managed by Avid and PACE.

### AU Support

To compile the AU & AUv3 versions of this plugin, ensure your **JUCE installation is correctly set up to include the AU SDK**, as it's typically bundled with JUCE.

Tuturial coming soon.

### AUv3 Support

To compile the VST3 version of this plugin, ensure your **JUCE installation is correctly set up to include the AUv3 SDK**, as it's typically bundled with JUCE.

Tuturial coming soon.
